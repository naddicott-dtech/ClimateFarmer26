# HANDOFF.md — Post-Slice 5d Completion Snapshot

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Status:** Slices 1-5d complete. Classroom-Ready Build deployed. Students start as early as Thursday March 13, 2026.

## What Was Built

### Slice 1 (Complete)
Core farming simulation loop: plant → grow → harvest → economy. 3 annual crops (silage corn, winter wheat, processing tomatoes), 8×8 grid with bulk ops, weather system, soil model, save/load, auto-pause, tutorial.

### Slice 2 (Complete)
Event/storylet engine + loans + 3 climate events (heatwave, water allocation cut, late frost). Perennial crops (almonds, pistachios) with dormancy, chill hours, establishment periods. Extension agent advisor (Dr. Maria Santos, 5 storylets). Emergency loan system. Fog-of-war for chill hours. Save migration V1→V2→V3.

### Slice 3 (Complete)
Stretch events (tomato surge, pumping ban). 2 new crops (sorghum, citrus navels — 7 total). Perennial yield curves (ramp→peak→decline). Cover crop system (legume, fall planting, spring auto-incorporation). Weather Service advisor (NWS Fresno, 3 storylets). Frost protection mechanism. Save migration V3→V4.

### Slice 4 (Complete)
- **4a:** Headless bot framework (6 bots: corn/almond monoculture, idle, diversified-adaptive, zero-irrigation, citrus-stability). 5 calibrated scenarios. Save migration V4→V5.
- **4b/4b.5:** Seasonal draw refactor (8 random-gated + 14 condition-only). Stress-modulated probability. Family caps. Save migration V5→V6.
- **4c:** Economic rebalancing — 4 levers (OM yield penalty, water allocation, N tightening, irrigation cost).
- **4d:** $2,000/year annual overhead. Save migration V6→V7.
- **4e:** Classroom UX clarity pass — 16 fixes including year-end expense breakdown, running net P/L, crop art overhaul, play prompt, confirm guards.
- **Stabilization:** TopBar CSS Grid layout (#78), perennial harvest UI fix (#79).

### Slice 5a: Systems Infrastructure (Complete)
New condition/effect types, `getTechLevel()` reconvergence (water/soil/crop tracks 0-3), K-lite potassium (per-cell depletion + price factor + symptom cues), auto-irrigation hook (tech-gated with cost multipliers), crop gating via `requiredFlag`, permanent regime shift modifiers (water/market/heat), separate tech/non-tech event clustering caps, harvest affordance count (#62), `pickMessage()` for message variety, agave as first gated crop. Save migration V7→V8. `SAVE_VERSION = '8.0.0'`.

### Slice 5b: Advisors + First Tech Branch (Complete)
Marcus Chen (`farm-credit`) + Valley Growers Forum (`growers-forum`) advisor characters with intro storylets. Water irrigation tech unlock (year 3, drip irrigation → auto-irrigation end-to-end). Auto-irrigation notification with 3-message rotating pool.

### Slice 5c: Full Content + Regime Shifts (Complete)
Remaining tech decisions (soil testing, crop tech, advanced water, late-game regime-aware offers). 3 regime shifts (water allocation reduction Y10-12, market crash Y15-18, heat threshold Y20-25). 2 novel crops (agave + heat-tolerant avocados). Year-30 reflection panel (#65). Tech soft-lock fix (#80). 19 condition types, 10 effect types, 22 storylets total (8 seasonal draw + 14 condition-only). 9 crops (4 annual + 5 perennial).

### Slice 5d: Balance + Validate (Complete)
- **5d.1:** UX fixes — advisor threshold tuning (#82), bulk plant full-field feedback (#81), year-end "before loan" conditional copy (#87), bankruptcy reflection on loan decline (#88).
- **5d.2 "Corn Dominance Fix":** Monoculture streak penalty (escalating yield loss: 2nd=0.85, 3rd=0.70, 4th=0.55, 5th+=0.50 floor), cover crop OM protection reduction (50% vs 100%), diversified bot rewrite (proper rotation). Balance result: diversified ($301K) > corn ($193K) > citrus ($86K), all 100% survival. 6 bots × 5 scenarios tested.

## Key Balance Mechanics

**Economic levers (4c/4d/5d.2):**
1. OM yield penalty: `computeOMYieldFactor()` — yield drops as OM declines (floor=0.40 at OM=0.5%)
2. Water allocation enforcement: `effectiveDose = WATER_DOSE_INCHES × allocation`
3. Nitrogen tightening: N consumed at harvest, mineralization via OM
4. Irrigation cost: $8/cell
5. Annual overhead: $2,000/year
6. Monoculture streak penalty: escalating yield loss for consecutive same annual crop per cell
7. Cover crop OM protection: 50% decomposition reduction (not halt)

**Balance results (5d.2, 75-run smoke suite):**
- Diversified-adaptive: 100% survival, $301K median
- Corn monoculture: 100% survival, $193K median
- Citrus stability: 100% survival, $86K median
- Almond monoculture: 0% survival (establishment cost kills)
- Zero irrigation: 0% survival
- Idle farm: 0% survival (bankrupt Y26-29)

## Open / Deferred Issues

### Known test issue
- Foreshadowing browser test (`game.spec.ts:890`) is flaky (~10% failure rate under `--repeat-each` stress). Non-blocking.

### Open issues (low severity)
- **#47:** Event clustering feels spammy in some seasons. Seasonal caps exist but not per-family mutual exclusion.
- **#70:** Confirm dialog can be overwritten by scripted interaction (automation-only, overlay blocks humans).
- **#83:** Economic tension under-signaled in UI (cash trend, bankruptcy warning).
- **#84:** Crop/water messaging inconsistency (winter wheat "low water" vs. water warnings).
- **#85:** Advisor advice in notification bar feels like background toast.
- **#86:** No guidance after mid-summer harvest leaves nothing plantable.

### Deferred features → Slice 6+
- **Scoring + completion code + Google Form** — Weighted composite scoring (SPEC §31) + end-of-game reporting
- **Corn heat/drought quality penalty** — Needs proper heat stress day tracking (separate from waterStressDays to avoid double-counting with waterFactor)
- **Monoculture pest event chain** — Rootworm, corn rot as foreshadowed storylets connecting to pellagra case study
- **Insurance / credit systems** — Credit rating, variable loan rates, insurance premiums
- **Automation policies** — Replant-same, harvest-when-ready, water-when-dry (beyond auto-irrigation)
- **Glossary / Information Index** — In-game educational reference with progressive disclosure
- **Solar lease event chain** — Multi-phase storylet (option → construction → operations → agrivoltaics)
- **Additional crops** — Table grapes (stretch). Stone Fruit, Opuntia, Guayule unlikely.
- **Zinc nutrient** — Deferred from K-lite implementation
- **Advanced accessibility** — Colorblind modes, full screen reader support
- **5 avocado art files** — ASSETS.md has specs
