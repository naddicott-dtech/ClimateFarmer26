# Asset Manifest — ClimateFarmer26

All visual assets for the game. This file is the single source of truth for what art is needed, where it goes, and its status.

## Naming Convention

`{asset-id}_{width}x{height}.jpeg`

Example: `extension-agent_128x128.jpeg`

This embeds the target pixel dimensions in the filename so artists know exactly what size to produce.

## Performance Budget

Target hardware is Chromebooks. Keep total asset payload under 2MB. Individual images should be optimized before committing.

## Advisor Portraits

Displayed in the EventPanel when advisor-type events fire. Mapped by `advisorId` in code via `ADVISOR_CHARACTERS` in `src/ui/components/EventPanel.tsx`.

| Asset ID | File Path | Dimensions | Used In | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|-------|
| `extension-agent` | `public/assets/advisors/extension-agent_128x128.jpeg` | 128x128 | EventPanel (Dr. Maria Santos) | Complete | Agricultural extension agent. Warm, approachable. |
| `weather-service` | `public/assets/advisors/weather-service_128x128.jpeg` | 128x128 | EventPanel (NWS Fresno) | Complete | Weather forecaster. Professional. |
| `default` | `public/assets/advisors/default_128x128.jpeg` | 128x128 | EventPanel (fallback) | Complete | Generic advisor silhouette. Used when advisorId has no matching portrait. |

### Advisor Portrait Spec

- **Size:** 128x128 pixels (renders at 64x64 CSS pixels for retina sharpness)
- **Style:** Friendly, approachable — these are educational characters for high school students
- **Framing:** Head and shoulders, centered
- **Rendering:** Rendered as `<img>` with `data-testid="advisor-portrait"`, circular crop via CSS `border-radius: 50%`

## Crop Art

All crop stages rendered as images on farm grid cells — no emoji. Mapped via `CROP_ART` in `src/ui/components/FarmCell.tsx`. Each crop has 4 growth stages (seedling, vegetative, flowering, mature) + harvestable/overripe. Deciduous perennials (almonds, pistachios) also have a dormant stage. Citrus is evergreen — no dormant art needed.

| Asset ID | File Path | Dimensions | Used In | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|-------|

### Growth Stage Art Direction (for prompting)

Each stage should be visually distinct from its neighbors. Crop art renders responsively to fill the farm cell (minus 4px padding).

- **Seedling:** Tiny green sprout emerging from brown soil. For trees: small sapling with 2-3 leaves. Predominantly soil-colored with a touch of green.
- **Vegetative:** Healthy leafy growth, no fruit/flowers visible. For trees: young tree with full leaf canopy. Predominantly green.
- **Flowering:** Crop-specific flowers visible. Tomatoes: yellow flowers. Corn: tassels. Wheat: heads forming. Trees: white/pink blossoms. Mix of green + flower color.
- **Mature:** Fruit/grain visible but not yet ripe. Tomatoes: green tomatoes on vine. Corn: full ears with husks. Wheat: golden heads. Trees: small green fruit among leaves. Transitioning toward harvest colors.
- **Dormant (deciduous trees only):** Bare branches, no leaves or fruit. Winter appearance. Brown/grey wood tones against soil. Distinct from seedling (no green).

### Crop Art Spec

- **Size:** 48x48 pixels (renders responsively to fill cell, CSS `width: calc(100% - 4px)`)
- **Style:** Stylized semi-realistic, painterly, approachable for high school students
- **Palette:** sun-baked earth (#A97142), wheat gold (#D8B45A), irrigation blue (#4A90B8), leaf green (#6FA35B), sky haze (#C9DCE8), orchard dark (#2F5D3A), accent orange (#E38B3A)
- **Background:** Soil/earth tones — crops sit on farm cells, so background should blend with the cell background. (The shared prompt says "transparent background" but all assets are JPEG — no transparency supported. Earth-toned backgrounds effectively achieve the same result.)
- **Constraints:** No text, no logos, no watermarks

  SHARED STYLE GUIDE:
  Stylized semi-realistic look with warmth and personality. Painterly forms, clean readable silhouette, subtle hand-crafted texture, approachable for high school
  students. Grounded and optimistic tone.
  Palette direction: sun-baked earth (#A97142), wheat gold (#D8B45A), irrigation blue (#4A90B8), leaf green (#6FA35B), sky haze (#C9DCE8), orchard dark (#2F5D3A),
  accent orange (#E38B3A).
  Lighting: soft daylight, gentle directional light, mild contrast, no harsh dramatic shadows.
  Composition: one clear centered subject, high readability at small size.
  Hard constraints: transparent background, no scene background, no text, no letters, no logos, no watermark, no frame, no UI elements.

  Example specific prompt:
    ASSET-SPECIFIC:
  Head-and-shoulders portrait of a friendly agricultural extension advisor (Latina woman, late 30s to early 40s), calm confident smile, practical field jacket over
