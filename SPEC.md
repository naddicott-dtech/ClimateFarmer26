# SPEC.md — Acceptance Tests & Requirements

> **Status: DRAFT — Slice 1 only. Not approved for implementation.**
> Format: **When** [user action], **I should see** [expected result].
> Negative cases use: **When** [action], **I should NOT see** [bad outcome] / **the system should** [prevent it].

### Terminology Note

Student-facing UI uses farm language: **"plots"** (not cells), **"field"** (not grid), **"rows"** and **"columns"**. Code and `data-testid` attributes use engineering terms (`farm-cell-3-7`, `farm-grid`) for consistency with ARCHITECTURE.md §11. This spec uses both: farm terms when describing what students see, code terms when referencing test IDs.

## Slice 1: Core Farm Loop

### Starting Conditions

These defaults are used throughout the tests below. If any change, the test values change with them.

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Starting cash | $50,000 | Enough for ~2 seasons of planting a full field; mistakes are affordable but not free |
| Starting season | Spring, Year 1, Day 1 | Spring is planting time — students can act immediately |
| Starting field | All 64 plots empty, all farmable | Clean slate; student's first decision is what to plant |
| Starting soil N | 100 lbs/acre per plot | Moderate — enough for one crop without fertilizer; depletion visible by year 2 |
| Starting soil OM | 2.0% | Typical Central Valley agricultural soil |
| Starting soil moisture | 4.0 inches (of 6.0 capacity) | Spring start with reasonable water; ~14 days before first watering needed in dry weather |
| Climate scenario | 1 scenario bundled ("Slice 1 Baseline") | Mild-to-moderate difficulty; includes one dry summer (Year 3) for drama |
| Speed on launch | Paused (0x) | Game starts paused so student can read the UI and choose first action |
| Crops available | Processing Tomatoes, Silage Corn, Winter Wheat | The 3 Slice 1 annuals |

### Locked Design Decisions

These were open questions in the first draft. Now resolved with Neal's input + Senior Engineer recommendation.

#### DD-1: Bulk operation when cash is insufficient
**Decision:** Confirmation dialog, rounded down to the maximum number of complete rows. The dialog uses farm terminology and keeps students in bulk-operation mode.

Example: Player clicks "Plant Field" with Silage Corn but can only afford 30 of 64 plots. Since a row is 8 plots, the system offers the nearest complete-row count: "You can afford to plant 3 full rows (24 plots) of Silage Corn for $2,400. Plant 3 rows?" Fill order: top-to-bottom (row 0 first), skipping rows that already have crops. If the student needs to plant the remaining rows later, they use "Plant Row" after earning more cash.

For "Plant Row" and "Plant Column" (max 8 plots): all-or-nothing, since the cost is small. "Not enough cash to plant this row ($800 needed, $600 available)."

For "Water Field" with insufficient cash: same pattern — round down to complete rows. "You can afford to water 5 rows (40 plots) for $200. Water 5 rows?"

#### DD-2: Year 30 ending & bankruptcy
**Year 30:** Game pauses with "You completed 30 years of farming! Final cash: $X." Simple message, no score or completion code (those are Slice 4).

**Bankruptcy:** Cash ≤ $0 is game over. The system shows a final report: what happened, what the student might try differently, and a "Start New Game" button. No emergency loans or further credit in Slice 1 (soft recovery with loans is Slice 2).

#### DD-3: Onboarding / first-time experience
**Decision:** Brief 3-step tooltip tour on first launch: "1. Click a plot to select it → 2. Plant a crop → 3. Press Play to start time." Includes a "Skip" button and a "Don't show again" checkbox (persisted in localStorage). All tooltip elements have `data-testid` attributes so AI test agents can click through or dismiss the tour programmatically.

#### DD-4: Overripe crop behavior
**Decision:** When a crop reaches harvestable stage, the game auto-pauses with options: "Harvest" (immediate) or "Continue" (dismiss and keep playing). If the student continues without harvesting, the crop enters a **30-day grace period.** During this period, yield degrades linearly (100% → 0%). After 30 days, the crop rots: yield drops to zero, the plot is cleared, and a notification explains the loss. The student learns to harvest on time.

*Future slice note:* In Slice 2+, rotting crops could trigger a secondary event offering to sell as animal feed at a steep discount. This doesn't exist in Slice 1.

#### DD-5: Watering model
**Decision:** Manual "biweekly dose" watering — each Water action provides enough moisture for approximately **14 days** (2 weeks) under typical summer ET conditions. This is the low-tech "sprinkler from a garden hose" level. The student decides when to water and whether the cost is worth it.

**Auto-pause for water stress:** The game auto-pauses the **first time per season** that any planted plot's moisture drops below 25% of capacity. The notification says "Some of your crops need water!" with a "Water Field" action button and a "Continue without watering" option. After this first warning per season, subsequent moisture drops show visual warnings on affected plots but do not auto-pause. This teaches the concept without nagging.

**Visual indicators (no auto-pause):** Plots show a yellow moisture warning at 30% capacity and a red wilting indicator at 15% capacity. These are always visible regardless of auto-pause history.

*Future slice note:* Irrigation system upgrades (drip, AI-driven), buying/leasing neighbor's water rights, and seasonal irrigation contracts are tech tree options in Slice 3+. Water rights trading is a real practice in California's San Joaquin Valley (~1.5M acre-feet traded annually).

### 1. New Game & Main Screen

#### 1.1 Game Launch
- **When** I open the app for the first time (no save data), **I should see** a "New Game" screen with a Player ID input field (labeled "Player ID", NOT "Name") and a "Start" button.
- **When** I enter a Player ID and click Start, **I should see** the main game screen: farm field (8x8 grid), top bar (date, cash, speed controls), side panel, and notification bar.
- **When** the game starts, **I should see** "Spring — Year 1" in the top bar, cash showing "$50,000", and all 64 plots empty.
- **When** the game starts, **I should see** the simulation paused (speed indicator shows paused).

#### 1.2 Player ID Validation
- **When** I try to start a game with an empty Player ID, **the system should** prevent it and show a message explaining a Player ID is needed.
- **When** I enter a Player ID with special characters or spaces, **the system should** accept it (students may use codes like "P3-14" or "Team Blue").
- **When** I enter a Player ID longer than 30 characters, **the system should** truncate to 30 characters and show the truncated result before the student clicks Start.

#### 1.3 First-Time Tutorial
- **When** I start a new game for the first time (no "Don't show again" flag in localStorage), **I should see** a 3-step tooltip tour: Step 1 highlights a plot ("Click a plot to select it"), Step 2 highlights the Plant button ("Plant a crop"), Step 3 highlights the Play button ("Press Play to start time").
- **When** I click "Next" on each tooltip step, **I should see** the next step. After the last step, the tour ends.
- **When** I click "Skip" at any point during the tour, **I should see** the tour close immediately.
- **When** I check "Don't show again" and finish or skip the tour, **the tour should NOT** appear on future game starts.
- **When** an AI test agent needs to bypass the tutorial, **it should** be able to click `tutorial-skip` to dismiss the tour in one action.

---

### 2. Farm Grid Interactions

#### 2.1 Plot Selection
- **When** I click a farm plot, **I should see** the plot highlighted and the side panel showing that plot's details: crop (or "Empty"), soil nitrogen, soil moisture, organic matter.
- **When** I click a different plot, **I should see** the selection move to the new plot and the side panel update.
- **When** I click the already-selected plot again, **I should see** the plot deselected and the side panel return to its default view (field summary).

#### 2.2 Planting — Single Plot
- **When** I click an empty plot and click "Plant...", **I should see** a crop selection menu listing the 3 available crops (Processing Tomatoes, Silage Corn, Winter Wheat) with their planting cost displayed per plot.
- **When** I select "Processing Tomatoes" from the crop menu, **I should see** the plot update to show a tomato indicator (seedling stage), and my cash decrease by the seed cost.
- **When** I try to plant in a plot that already has a crop, **the system should** disable the "Plant" button (greyed out). Tooltip: "This plot already has a crop."
- **When** I try to plant a crop outside its planting window (e.g., tomatoes in winter), **the system should** show that crop greyed out in the menu with a tooltip: "Planting window: March–May."
- **When** I don't have enough cash to plant a crop, **the system should** show that crop greyed out in the menu with a tooltip: "Cost: $150. Available: $80."

#### 2.3 Planting — Bulk Operations
- **When** I click "Plant Field" with a crop selected and enough cash for all empty plots, **I should see** a confirmation: "Plant all 64 plots with Silage Corn for $6,400?" After confirming, all empty plots are planted, cash is reduced, and a notification shows how many plots were planted.
- **When** I click "Plant Row 3" with a crop selected, **I should see** all empty plots in row 3 (up to 8) planted, and only those plots' cost deducted.
- **When** I click "Plant Column 5" with a crop selected, **I should see** all empty plots in column 5 (up to 8) planted.
- **When** some plots in a row are already occupied and I use "Plant Row", **I should see** only the empty plots get planted. Already-occupied plots are untouched. Cost reflects only the plots actually planted.
- **When** I click "Plant Field" but can only afford a partial field, **I should see** a confirmation dialog offering the maximum number of complete rows I can afford: "You can afford to plant 3 full rows (24 plots) of Silage Corn for $2,400. Plant 3 rows?" Fill order: top-to-bottom, skipping rows with existing crops.
- **When** I can't afford even one complete row (8 plots), **the system should** show: "Not enough cash to plant a full row. Cost per row: $800, Available: $600." The student can still plant individual plots.

#### 2.4 Harvesting — Single Plot
- **When** I click a plot with a crop in "harvestable" stage, **I should see** a "Harvest" button enabled in the side panel.
- **When** I click "Harvest" on a harvestable plot, **I should see** the crop removed from the plot (plot becomes empty), cash increase by the harvest revenue, and a notification showing yield and revenue (e.g., "Harvested Processing Tomatoes: 32 tons at $70/ton = $2,240").
- **When** I click a plot with a crop that isn't harvestable yet (still growing), **I should see** the "Harvest" button disabled with a tooltip showing growth progress: "Silage Corn — 65% grown. Ready in ~20 days."
- **When** a crop is in its 30-day overripe grace period, **I should see** a warning indicator on the plot (amber color) and reduced yield shown in the side panel: "Yield: 85% (overripe — harvest soon!)".

#### 2.5 Harvesting — Bulk Operations
- **When** I click "Harvest Field", **I should see** all harvestable plots harvested at once, total revenue displayed in a summary notification, and plots cleared to empty.
- **When** I click "Harvest Row 2", **I should see** only harvestable plots in row 2 harvested.
- **When** no plots are harvestable and I click "Harvest Field", **the system should** show a notification: "No crops ready to harvest."

#### 2.6 Watering
- **When** I click "Water Field", **I should see** all planted plots receive irrigation (providing ~14 days of moisture under typical conditions), cash decrease by irrigation cost, and soil moisture bars update in the side panel.
- **When** I click "Water Row" or "Water Column", **I should see** only plots in that scope irrigated.
- **When** I click "Water Field" but can only afford partial coverage, **I should see** a confirmation offering the maximum number of complete rows: "You can afford to water 5 rows (40 plots) for $200. Water 5 rows?"
- **When** all plots are already at maximum moisture and I water anyway, **the system should** still deduct the cost. Excess water is wasted (runoff). This teaches about over-irrigation — a real agricultural problem.
- **When** soil moisture is above 80% capacity on a plot, **I should see** a hint in the plant menu: "Soil moisture is high — watering may not be needed yet."

---

### 3. Time & Simulation

#### 3.1 Speed Controls
- **When** I click the Play button (1x), **I should see** the simulation start running — the date in the top bar advances day by day, and crop growth progresses visibly.
- **When** I click 2x speed, **I should see** time advance roughly twice as fast as 1x.
- **When** I click 4x speed, **I should see** time advance roughly four times as fast as 1x.
- **When** I click Pause, **I should see** time stop — the date freezes, no simulation ticks occur, but I can still interact with the field and panels.
- **When** I change speed while the game is running, **I should see** the speed change take effect immediately (no need to pause first).

#### 3.2 Calendar Display
- **When** the simulation is running, **I should see** the current date displayed in the top bar showing at minimum: the season name (Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter), the current month, and the year number (Year 1 through Year 30).
- **When** the season changes (e.g., Spring → Summer), **I should see** the season display update and a brief notification marking the transition ("Summer — Year 1").
- **When** the year changes (Day 365 → Day 1 of next year), **I should see** an end-of-year summary showing: total revenue, total expenses, net profit/loss, ending cash balance, and a brief narrative about the year.

#### 3.3 Crop Growth Progression
- **When** a crop is planted and time passes, **I should see** the crop's growth stage advance: seedling → vegetative → flowering → mature → harvestable.
- **When** I select a growing plot, **I should see** a growth progress indicator in the side panel (e.g., a bar showing GDD accumulated vs. GDD needed).
- **When** the temperature is too cold for growth (below crop's GDD base temp), **I should see** the crop's growth stall — no visible progress on cold days.
- **When** I plant Winter Wheat in fall and the season turns cold, **I should see** it grow slowly (it has a lower base temp than tomatoes/corn), demonstrating it's suited for cool seasons.

#### 3.4 Weather Display
- **When** the simulation is running, **I should see** a current weather indicator somewhere on screen showing approximate temperature and whether it's a rainy day, dry day, or hot day.
- **When** a day is notably hot (heat event), **I should see** a visual cue (warm color, heat icon).
- **When** it rains, **I should see** a rain indicator and soil moisture increase in the affected plots.

#### 3.5 Season & Planting Windows
- **When** it's Spring, **I should see** Processing Tomatoes and Silage Corn available in the plant menu (these are warm-season crops).
- **When** it's Fall, **I should see** Winter Wheat available in the plant menu (it's a cool-season crop).
- **When** it's midsummer, **I should see** that tomatoes and corn may still be plantable (if within their window) but Winter Wheat is greyed out with tooltip: "Planting window: October–November."
- **When** I try to plant a crop outside its planting window, **the system should** prevent it — the crop appears greyed out in the menu with its planting window shown.

#### 3.6 Auto-Pause Triggers (Slice 1)

The game auto-pauses for these events. Each auto-pause shows a notification with action buttons.

| Trigger | Notification | Actions |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Any crop reaches harvestable stage | "Your [crop] is ready to harvest!" | "Harvest Field" / "Harvest [scope]" / "Continue" |
| First moisture drop below 25% capacity per season | "Some of your crops need water!" | "Water Field" / "Continue without watering" |
| Cash drops to ≤ $0 | "You've run out of money." | Shows game-over panel (see §5.4) |
| Year ends (Day 365) | Year-end summary panel | "Continue to Year N+1" |
| Year 30 ends | "Congratulations! You completed 30 years." | Shows final cash, "Start New Game" |

- **When** multiple auto-pause conditions trigger on the same tick, **the system should** queue them and show them one at a time, most urgent first (bankruptcy > harvest ready > water stress > year end).

#### 3.7 Overripe Crop Lifecycle
- **When** a crop reaches "harvestable" and the game auto-pauses, **I should see** options to harvest or continue playing.
- **When** I click "Continue" without harvesting, **I should see** the crop enter a 30-day grace period. The plot shows an amber "overripe" indicator. The side panel shows: "Overripe — yield declining. 25 days until crop loss."
- **When** the grace period is active and I select the plot, **I should see** the current yield percentage decreasing (e.g., "Yield: 72% of maximum. Harvest now or lose it in 18 days.").
- **When** the 30-day grace period expires without harvest, **I should see** the crop removed, the plot cleared to empty, and a notification: "Your [crop] rotted in the field. Total loss." Revenue: $0.
- **When** I harvest during the grace period, **I should see** yield proportional to how many grace days remain (day 0 of grace = 100%, day 15 = 50%, day 30 = 0%).

---

### 4. Nitrogen & Soil (Slice 1 — N only)

#### 4.1 Nitrogen Display
- **When** I select a plot, **I should see** its soil nitrogen level displayed as a number and a visual bar in the side panel (e.g., "N: 72 lbs/acre" with a colored bar).
- **When** nitrogen is high (≥80 lbs/acre), **I should see** a green indicator.
- **When** nitrogen is moderate (40–79 lbs/acre), **I should see** a yellow indicator.
- **When** nitrogen is low (<40 lbs/acre), **I should see** a red indicator and a narrative hint in the notification bar (e.g., "Your crops in row 3 look unusually pale this season.").

#### 4.2 Nitrogen Depletion
- **When** I plant tomatoes (heavy N feeder) and harvest, **I should see** the plot's nitrogen level significantly reduced after harvest.
- **When** I plant the same plot with tomatoes again without adding nitrogen, **I should see** lower yield the second time, and the notification bar should hint at the reason.
- **When** I plant corn (moderate N feeder) and harvest, **I should see** less nitrogen depletion than tomatoes.
- **When** I let a plot sit empty for a season, **I should see** nitrogen slowly recover via organic matter mineralization (but slowly — not enough to sustain continuous heavy cropping).

#### 4.3 Nitrogen & Yield Relationship
- **When** a plot has full nitrogen and adequate water, **I should see** yield at or near the crop's maximum potential.
- **When** a plot has low nitrogen but adequate water, **I should see** yield reduced proportionally (the formula: yield × min(1, soilN / cropNitrogenUptake)).
- **When** both nitrogen and water are low, **I should see** yield reduced by BOTH factors (they compound — this is a key learning moment).

#### 4.4 Soil Moisture
- **When** I select a plot, **I should see** its soil moisture level displayed (numerical + bar).
- **When** it doesn't rain and I don't irrigate, **I should see** soil moisture decrease daily (due to evapotranspiration).
- **When** I irrigate, **I should see** moisture increase. Excess above capacity is wasted (runoff).
- **When** moisture drops below 30% capacity, **I should see** a yellow moisture warning on the plot.
- **When** moisture drops below 15% capacity, **I should see** a red wilting indicator on the plot, and the crop accumulates stress days that reduce final yield.

#### 4.5 Organic Matter (Passive Simulation)
The engine fully simulates OM changes each tick. However, there are no Slice 1 player actions that directly control OM (cover crops and compost are Slice 3). OM is an observable indicator that changes slowly based on cropping decisions.

- **When** I select a plot, **I should see** its organic matter percentage displayed (e.g., "OM: 2.0%").
- **When** I grow crops and harvest for several years, **I should see** OM decrease very slowly (noticeable over 5+ years, not season-to-season).
- **When** OM decreases, **I should see** the plot's moisture capacity decrease slightly (the OM → water-holding relationship: each 1% OM ≈ +0.8 inches capacity).

---

### 5. Economy

#### 5.1 Cash Display
- **When** I look at the top bar, **I should see** my current cash balance displayed prominently.
- **When** I plant crops, **I should see** cash decrease immediately and the new balance shown.
- **When** I harvest, **I should see** cash increase and the new balance shown.
- **When** I irrigate, **I should see** cash decrease and the new balance shown.
- **When** cash changes, **I should see** a brief green flash (increase) or red flash (decrease) on the cash display, making the change noticeable.

#### 5.2 Cost Transparency
- **When** I open the plant menu, **I should see** the per-plot cost for each crop (seed cost).
- **When** I'm about to do a bulk operation, **I should see** the total cost in the confirmation dialog before committing (e.g., "Plant 64 plots of Corn for $6,400?").
- **When** I harvest, **I should see** both yield and revenue clearly (e.g., "32 tons × $70/ton = $2,240").
- **When** I irrigate, **I should see** the irrigation cost (per plot × number of plots watered).

#### 5.3 Year-End Summary
- **When** Year 1 ends, **I should see** a summary panel showing:
  - Total revenue from all harvests this year
  - Total expenses (planting + irrigation)
  - Net profit or loss
  - Ending cash balance
  - Brief narrative about what happened ("Year 1: You planted 32 plots of corn and 16 plots of tomatoes...")
- **When** I have a profitable year, **I should see** a positive tone in the summary.
- **When** I lose money, **I should see** a cautionary tone (not punishing, but clear that expenses exceeded revenue).

#### 5.4 Bankruptcy
- **When** my cash drops to $0 or below, **the system should** auto-pause and display a game-over panel with:
  - A final report: starting cash, total revenue, total expenses, what went wrong
  - A suggestion for what to try differently (e.g., "Consider diversifying crops" or "Watch soil nitrogen levels")
  - A "Start New Game" button
- **When** I have crops still growing but cash is $0, **the system should** still trigger game over — there is no credit in Slice 1. (Emergency loans are a Slice 2 feature.)
- **When** I reach game over, **I should NOT** be forced to close and reopen the browser. The "Start New Game" button returns to the new-game screen.

#### 5.5 Economic Realism Checks (Engine Tests)
- **When** I plant a full field (64 plots) of Processing Tomatoes and successfully grow/harvest them with adequate water and nitrogen, **the revenue should** exceed the planting + irrigation costs (farming a full field well should be profitable).
- **When** I plant tomatoes repeatedly on the same plots without managing nitrogen, **I should see** yields decline year-over-year until farming becomes unprofitable (demonstrating soil depletion).
- **When** I do nothing (don't plant anything), **I should NOT see** cash change at all (no mysterious charges with no crops). Cash should remain at starting value.
- **When** the dry summer hits (Year 3 in baseline scenario), **I should see** higher water stress on crops unless I irrigate more often, resulting in lower yields — a natural demonstration of climate risk.

---

### 6. Save & Resume

#### 6.1 Auto-Save
- **When** a season transition occurs (every ~90 in-game days), **the system should** automatically save the game state to localStorage.
- **When** I close the browser tab and reopen the app, **I should see** a "Continue" option alongside "New Game" that loads from the most recent auto-save.
- **When** I click "Continue", **I should see** the game resume in exactly the state I left it: same day, same cash, same crops, same soil conditions, same Player ID.

#### 6.2 Manual Save
- **When** I click the "Save" button, **I should see** the game saved to a named slot with a timestamp.
- **When** I have a saved game and start a new one, **the old save should** still be accessible from a load menu.
- **When** localStorage is full, **the system should** show a warning rather than silently failing.

#### 6.3 Save Integrity
- **When** I save, close, and reload, **the game state should** be identical: same day, same cash (to the cent), same soil values per plot, same crop growth stages, same RNG state. A headless test can verify this by comparing serialized state before save and after load.
- **When** I resume and unpause, **the simulation should** continue deterministically from where it left off (same RNG state).
- **When** a save file is corrupted (manually tampered with), **the system should** detect the problem and show an error rather than loading into a broken state.

---

### 7. Accessibility (Baseline — Slice 1)

#### 7.1 Keyboard Navigation
- **When** I press Tab, **I should see** focus move through all interactive elements in a logical order: top bar controls → grid plots → side panel buttons → action buttons.
- **When** a grid plot has focus and I press Enter, **I should see** the same behavior as clicking it (select/deselect).
- **When** I'm in the crop menu and press Escape, **I should see** the menu close without making a selection.
- **When** I use arrow keys on the grid, **I should see** focus move to adjacent plots (left/right/up/down).

#### 7.2 Focus Indicators
- **When** any interactive element has keyboard focus, **I should see** a clearly visible focus ring or highlight (not just the default browser outline — it must be visible against the game's background colors).

#### 7.3 ARIA Labels
- **When** a screen reader reads a grid plot, **it should** announce the plot's contents meaningfully (e.g., "Row 3, Column 5: Processing Tomatoes, vegetative stage, nitrogen 68" not just "cell").
- **When** a screen reader reads a speed control button, **it should** announce the current state (e.g., "Pause — currently playing at 1x speed").
- **When** a notification appears, **it should** be announced to screen readers (using an ARIA live region).

---

### 8. UI Polish & Clarity (Slice 1 Minimum)

#### 8.1 Responsive Basics
- **When** I view the game on a 1366×768 screen (common Chromebook resolution), **I should see** the full game interface without horizontal scrolling. Grid plots should be large enough to be easily clickable.
- **When** I view the game on a 1920×1080 screen, **I should see** the interface scale up gracefully (larger plots, more whitespace, same layout).

#### 8.2 Plot Visual States
- **When** a plot is empty, **I should see** it displayed as bare soil (distinct from planted plots).
- **When** a plot has a growing crop, **I should see** an indicator of which crop it is and its approximate growth stage (visual difference between seedling and mature).
- **When** a plot's crop is harvestable, **I should see** a clear "ready" visual (distinct color, icon, or badge — e.g., golden border).
- **When** a plot's crop is overripe (in grace period), **I should see** an amber warning indicator distinct from the harvestable state.
- **When** a plot's soil moisture is below 30%, **I should see** a yellow dryness indicator.
- **When** a plot's soil moisture is below 15%, **I should see** a red wilting indicator.

#### 8.3 Notification Bar
- **When** something notable happens (harvest, season change, low nitrogen hint, water stress), **I should see** a message appear in the notification bar at the bottom of the screen.
- **When** I click "Dismiss" on a notification, **I should see** it disappear.
- **When** multiple notifications queue up, **I should see** them displayed in order (newest first or a count indicator showing how many are pending).

#### 8.4 Empty State
- **When** I start a new game and the field is empty (after completing or skipping the tutorial), **I should see** a subtle prompt: "Select a plot and plant your first crop!"

---

### 9. Performance

#### 9.1 Frame Rate
- **When** running at 4x speed with a full field of growing crops, **the game should** maintain at least 30fps on a 2023 Chromebook (Intel N100, 4GB RAM, Chrome OS).
- **When** running at 1x speed, **the game should** feel smooth with no perceptible lag between clicking a button and seeing its effect.

#### 9.2 Simulation Tick Speed
- **When** running headless engine tests, **a single simulation tick should** complete in ≤4ms (hard ceiling; typical should be ≤1ms).
- **When** running at 4x speed (48 ticks/sec) at 30fps, **the engine runs ~2 ticks per frame.** Total simulation time per frame should be ≤8ms, leaving ≥25ms of the 33ms frame budget for rendering.

*Math: 1x = 12 ticks/sec. 4x = 48 ticks/sec. At 30fps: 48 ÷ 30 ≈ 1.6 ticks/frame (rounded up to 2). At 2 ticks × 4ms ceiling = 8ms max sim cost per frame.*

#### 9.3 Load Time
- **When** I open the app, **I should see** the game interface rendered and interactive within 4 seconds on a Chromebook (including loading the climate scenario data).
- **When** the JS bundle is measured, **it should** be ≤200KB gzipped.

---

### 10. Negative Cases & Edge Cases

#### 10.1 Rapid Clicking
- **When** I rapidly click "Plant Field" multiple times, **the system should** only plant once (idempotent — second click sees plots already occupied). Cash should only be deducted once.
- **When** I rapidly click "Harvest Field" multiple times, **the system should** only harvest once (second click finds no harvestable plots).

#### 10.2 Speed + Actions
- **When** I issue a plant command while the game is running at 4x, **the system should** process the command at the correct in-game time (not duplicated across ticks).
- **When** I pause, plant, then unpause, **the game should** resume with the crop already in the ground at the day it was planted.

#### 10.3 Season Boundaries
- **When** the last day of a season ticks over, **the system should** transition cleanly to the next season with no visual glitches and no simulation errors.
- **When** Year 30 ends, **the system should** show "Congratulations! You completed 30 years of farming!" with final cash balance and a "Start New Game" button.

#### 10.4 Empty Field + No Cash
- **When** I let time run with no crops planted, **the system should** still tick correctly (soil moisture changes with weather, but no crop-related calculations). Cash remains unchanged.
- **When** I have no crops, no harvestable crops, and cash ≤ $0, **the system should** trigger game over (see §5.4).

#### 10.5 Invalid States
- **When** a simulation bug causes NaN or Infinity in any value (cash, soil N, moisture, yield), **the system should** catch it via runtime assertions and pause with an error message rather than silently propagating bad data. (This is a test for the engine, not something the student should ever see.)
- **When** the game attempts to read a crop definition that doesn't exist (bad cropId), **the system should** throw a clear error at command validation time, not during growth simulation.

## Slice 2: Events, Perennials, Loans & Advisor

> **Status: APPROVED — Locked for implementation.**
> Sub-sliced into 2a (events + loans), 2b (perennials), 2c (advisor + chill hours).

### Slice 2 Scope Lock

- **Core (must ship):** Storylet/event engine + foreshadowing + 1 advisor (extension agent) + perennials (almonds, pistachios) + 3 events + minimal emergency loan
- **Stretch (only after Core passes all gates):** Market price fluctuation events OR a 2nd advisor
- **Deferred to Slice 3:** Tech tree, remaining advisors, insurance, credit systems, perennial decline phase

---

### Sub-Slice 2a: Event System + Emergency Loan

#### 12. Event System

##### 12.1 Event Triggers
- **When** the game simulation is running and an event's preconditions are met, **the system should** auto-pause and display an event panel with the event title, description, and choice buttons.
- **When** an event fires, **I should see** the event panel overlay with clearly described choices and their costs/consequences.
- **When** I click a choice button, **I should see** the effects applied immediately (cash changes, notifications, etc.) and the game resume.
- **When** multiple events are eligible on the same tick, **the system should** select the highest-priority event (priority >= 100 is guaranteed; otherwise weighted random by priority).
- **When** an event has a cooldown, **the system should NOT** fire the same event again within the cooldown period.

##### 12.2 Concrete Events (2a)
- **When** it is summer, year 2+, **I may see** a "Heatwave Advisory" event. Choices: Emergency irrigation ($500, moisture boost) or Wait and hope (yield penalty for 14 days).
- **When** it is summer, year 3+, **I may see** a "Water Allocation Cut" event. Choices: Accept higher costs (irrigation +50% for 90 days) or Cut irrigation (watering restricted 45 days).
- **When** it is spring, crops are planted, **I may see** a "Late Frost Warning" event. Choices: Frost protection ($300) or Accept the risk (yield penalty for 7 days).

##### 12.3 Foreshadowing
- **When** an event with foreshadowing is approaching, **I should see** a notification N days before the event fires (e.g., "Weather service reports: high pressure building. Possible record heat next week.").
- **When** foreshadowing has reliability < 1.0, **I may see** false alarms — the notification appears but the event does not fire. A follow-up notification should say the predicted event did not materialize.
- **When** foreshadowing fires and the event follows, **I should see** the event panel auto-pause when the foreshadowed day arrives.

##### 12.4 Event Effects
- **When** an event choice applies a yield modifier, **I should see** affected crop harvests reflect the modifier during the effect duration.
- **When** an event choice applies a watering restriction, **the system should** block WATER commands for the duration. Water buttons should be disabled with a tooltip explaining the restriction.
- **When** multiple active effects stack on the same crop, **the system should** multiply them together (e.g., two 0.85 modifiers = 0.7225). Modifier product is clamped to [0.0, 10.0].
- **When** an active effect's duration expires, **I should see** it stop affecting calculations immediately.

#### 13. Emergency Loan

##### 13.1 First Bankruptcy — Loan Offer
- **When** my cash drops to $0 or below for the first time, **I should NOT** see a game-over screen. Instead, the game auto-pauses with a loan offer panel showing: the loan amount, 10% annual interest rate, and a warning that this is a one-time opportunity.
- **When** the loan is offered, the amount **should be** automatically calculated by the engine: enough to cover my deficit plus a $5,000 buffer, rounded up to the nearest $1,000.
- **When** I click "Accept Loan", **I should see** my cash increase by the loan amount, a debt counter appear in the top bar, and the game resume.
- **When** I click "Decline Loan", **I should see** the game-over panel (same as Slice 1 bankruptcy).

##### 13.2 Debt Mechanics
- **When** I have outstanding debt, **I should see** it displayed in the top bar next to cash (e.g., "Cash: $12,000 | Debt: $8,000" with debt in red).
- **When** I harvest a crop while in debt, **I should see** 20% of the gross harvest revenue automatically applied to debt repayment, with a notification explaining the deduction (e.g., "$200 applied to loan repayment. Remaining debt: $7,800").
- **When** the year ends and I have debt, **I should see** interest paid and remaining debt in the year-end summary.
- **When** my cash drops to $0 or below a second time (after already taking a loan), **I should see** the game-over panel — no second loans.
- **When** my debt exceeds $100,000, **I should see** the game-over panel with a message about debt becoming unsustainable.

#### 14. Auto-Pause Priorities (Slice 2 additions)

| Reason | Priority | New in Slice 2? |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| bankruptcy | 100 | No |
| year_30 | 100 | No |
| loan_offer | 95 | Yes |
| event | 85 | Yes |
| advisor | 82 | Yes |
| harvest_ready | 80 | No |
| water_stress | 60 | No |
| year_end | 40 | No |

#### 15. Save Versioning
- **When** I load a v2 save, **the system should** load it normally.
- **When** I load a v1 save (from Slice 1), **the system should** either fill missing fields with safe defaults and load, or show "Save from older version — please start a new game." Either is acceptable.

---

### Sub-Slice 2b: Perennial Crops

#### 16. Perennial Planting

##### 16.1 Crop Menu
- **When** I open the plant menu, **I should see** perennial crops (Almonds, Pistachios) alongside annual crops, with their establishment cost shown (e.g., "$960/plot") and a warning: "Takes 3 years before first harvest."
- **When** it is outside the perennial planting window (Jan-Mar), **I should see** perennial crops greyed out with tooltip: "Planting window: January–March."
- **When** I don't have enough cash for the establishment cost, **I should see** the perennial crop greyed out with tooltip showing cost vs. available cash.

##### 16.2 Establishment Period
- **When** I plant almonds, **I should see** a tree indicator in the cell and "Establishing — Year 1/3" in the side panel.
- **When** time passes during establishment, **I should see** the year counter increment at year boundaries (Year 1/3 → Year 2/3 → Year 3/3 → "Producing").
- **When** a perennial crop is in establishment, **I should NOT** see a "Harvest" button or any harvest revenue.
- **When** the year ends with perennials planted, **I should see** maintenance costs deducted ($200/plot for almonds, $180/plot for pistachios) in the year-end summary.

##### 16.3 Dormancy
- **When** winter arrives and I have perennials, **I should see** the perennial cells show a muted/dormant visual (distinct from growing state).
- **When** a perennial is dormant, **I should NOT** see GDD accumulation or growth stage changes.
- **When** spring arrives after dormancy, **I should see** the perennial resume normal growth.

##### 16.4 Perennial Harvest
- **When** a perennial crop reaches harvestable stage (after establishment), **I should see** the auto-pause and harvest option, same as annuals.
- **When** I harvest a perennial crop, **I should see** revenue added to cash but the crop REMAINS in the cell (not cleared to empty). The cell shows the tree still present.
- **When** a perennial crop becomes overripe, **I should see** the same 30-day grace period as annuals, BUT the crop survives (yield = 0 for that year, crop is not destroyed).

##### 16.5 Perennial Removal
- **When** I select a cell with a perennial crop, **I should see** a "Remove" button in the side panel (not available for annual crops).
- **When** I click "Remove", **I should see** a confirmation dialog: "Remove almonds? This costs $500 and cannot be undone. The plot will be cleared for replanting."
- **When** I confirm removal, **I should see** the removal cost deducted, the cell cleared to empty, and a notification confirming the removal.

##### 16.6 Hard Boundary (NOT in 2b)
- **I should NOT** see any chill-hour data, chill-hour warnings, or chill-related yield penalties in Sub-Slice 2b. Chill mechanics ship in 2c.
- **I should NOT** see yield decline over time. Binary yield only: 0 during establishment, full production after.

---

### Sub-Slice 2c: Extension Agent Advisor + Chill Hours

#### 17. Extension Agent Advisor

##### 17.1 Advisor Appearance
- **When** the extension agent's trigger conditions are met, **the system should** auto-pause and show an advisor panel with: the advisor's name ("Dr. Maria Santos"), role ("County Extension Agent"), and dialogue text with recommendations.
- **When** the advisor panel appears, **I should see** 1-2 choice buttons (e.g., "Thanks for the advice" or "Tell me more about pistachios").
- **When** I click a choice, **I should see** the advisor panel dismiss and the game resume.

##### 17.2 Advisor Triggers
- **When** my average soil nitrogen drops below 50 lbs/acre (year 2+), **I should see** the extension agent recommend crop rotation.
- **When** I experience my first crop failure, **I should see** the extension agent recommend diversification.
- **When** I have perennials planted and it's year 8+, **I should see** the extension agent warn about declining chill hours and suggest pistachios.
- **When** my cash drops below $30,000 (year 4+), **I should see** the extension agent offer water conservation tips.
- **When** my cash is above $40,000, I have no debt, and no perennials (year 3+), **I should see** the extension agent suggest planting perennial crops (one-time).

##### 17.3 Advisor Cooldowns
- **When** the extension agent has appeared recently (within cooldown period), **the system should NOT** show the same advisor message again. Each trigger has its own cooldown.
- **When** I play a full 30-year game with poor practices (monoculture, no rotation), **I should see** the extension agent appear at least 3 times with relevant advice.

#### 18. Chill Hours

##### 18.1 Fog-of-War Reveal
- **When** I start a new game, **I should NOT** see any chill-hour data in the side panel.
- **When** the extension agent fires the chill-hour warning (trigger #3) OR I plant my first perennial, **I should see** chill-hour data appear in the side panel for perennial cells. This is permanent — once revealed, it stays visible.
- **When** chill-hour data is revealed, **I should see** the current winter's accumulated chill hours and the crop's requirement (e.g., "Chill hours: 680 / 700 required").

##### 18.2 Chill-Hour Mechanics
- **When** winter arrives and I have perennials, **the system should** accumulate chill hours based on winter temperatures.
- **When** a perennial's accumulated chill hours are below its requirement at spring, **I should see** a yield penalty proportional to the deficit.
- **When** the climate scenario has declining chill hours over 30 years, **I should see** almonds (700 required) become unreliable before pistachios (600 required) — this is the core teachable moment.
- **When** chill-hour deficit causes a yield penalty, **I should see** an explanation in the side panel or notification (e.g., "Insufficient winter chill: almond yield reduced to 60%.").

##### 18.3 Chill Hours in Scenario Data
- **When** the scenario generates winter weather, **the system should** use pre-defined chill hours that decline over 30 years: ~800 (years 1-5) → ~700 (years 6-15) → ~630 (years 16-25) → ~570 (years 26-30).

#### 19. Stretch Events (only after Core passes stretch gate)

##### 19.1 Market Price Fluctuation
- **When** it is not winter, year 2+, **I may see** a "Tomato Market Surge" event. Single choice: Acknowledge (tomato price x1.4 for 60 days).
- **When** a price modifier is active, **I should see** affected crop harvests reflect the modified price.

##### 19.2 Regulatory Water Restriction
- **When** it is summer, year 5+, **I may see** a "Groundwater Pumping Ban" event. Choices: Comply (no irrigation 30 days) or Buy surface water rights ($1,000).
