Net: about $3,250 per plot. Corn is $50/ton at 35 tons — $1,750 gross, $250 in costs, net $1,500. Winter wheat: $7/bushel at 80 bushels — $560 gross, just $100 in costs. When cash is tight, every dollar of seed money needs to earn its keep. Plant your highest-margin crop first, leave low-margin plots fallow if you can't afford to water them all.

But once producing, a mature almond orchard generates strong annual revenue for 15-20 years. Pistachios are similar: $900 to plant, 4 years to establish, but they're more drought-tolerant and need fewer chill hours than almonds. The catch? You can't rotate a tree.
