# KNOWN_ISSUES.md

## Pre-Development (Planning Phase)

### Resolved from Senior Engineer Review (2026-02-12)

1. **Climate data size** — Original design stored 10,950 daily weather entries per scenario (~500KB-1MB each). Revised to seasonal parameters + procedural daily generation (~10KB each). Resolved in ARCHITECTURE.md §5.3.

2. **Command type safety** — Original `Command` interface used `payload: unknown`, defeating TypeScript safety. Revised to discriminated union with fully-typed command variants. Resolved in ARCHITECTURE.md §5.2.

3. **localStorage bloat** — Original save included full command log (unbounded growth). Revised to state-snapshot-only saves (~20-30KB). No undo/rewind. localStorage budget: 5-10MB available, well within limits. Resolved in ARCHITECTURE.md §5.12.

4. **Privacy/student data** — Original design stored "studentName" in save and completion code. Revised to "playerId" (teacher-assigned code or nickname). App does not require PII, but cannot prevent students from entering identifiable info as their Player ID — teachers should instruct use of assigned codes. Added privacy section to ARCHITECTURE.md §10.

5. **Doc drift (lettuce)** — Test example referenced lettuce, which isn't in the San Joaquin Valley crop roster. Fixed to sorghum.

6. **Undo references** — Stale references to undo/replay capability removed after decision to not support undo (saves are snapshots, not command logs).

7. **Open question categorization** — Split into blocking-for-Slice-1, blocking-for-Slice-2, and deferrable. Added in ARCHITECTURE.md §14.

8. **Scope risk / slicing** — Added explicit Slice 1-4 breakdown in ARCHITECTURE.md §13, defining what's in each slice and what the acceptance gate is.

9. **data-testid naming convention** — Added standard in ARCHITECTURE.md §11.

### Resolved from SPEC.md Senior Engineer Review (2026-02-12)

10. **Conflicting performance criteria** — SPEC.md stated tick ≤4ms AND 48 ticks/frame ≤16ms (which implies ≤0.33ms/tick). The "48 ticks per frame" math was wrong: at 4x speed (48 ticks/sec) and 30fps, there are ~2 ticks per frame, not 48. Fixed in SPEC.md §9.2 and ARCHITECTURE.md §3.

11. **Ambiguous either/or acceptance tests** — Several tests said "either X or Y" which blocks deterministic implementation. Each resolved to a single behavior: disabled buttons with tooltips (not messages). Resolved in SPEC.md §2.2, §2.4.

12. **Watering pacing math inconsistent** — Original claimed "every 2-3 real-time seconds" but calculated "week in ~0.6s." Resolved by switching to 14-day water dose with first-per-season auto-pause at 25% moisture. Resolved in SPEC.md DD-5.

13. **OM "display-only" contradiction** — Section said "display only" but tested simulation changes (OM decrease, moisture capacity effect). Clarified: OM is fully simulated by the engine, but no Slice 1 player actions control it directly. It's "passively simulated," not "display only." Resolved in SPEC.md §4.5.

14. **Bankruptcy behavior ambiguous** — Three sections described slightly different conditions. Unified: cash ≤ $0 = game over in Slice 1 (no credit, no loans until Slice 2). Resolved in SPEC.md §5.4.

15. **DD-4 title mislabeled** — "What happens to crops in wrong season" was actually about overripe behavior. Retitled and resolved as 30-day grace period with linear yield decay. Resolved in SPEC.md DD-4, §3.7.

### Resolved from Slice 1 Implementation Review (2026-02-12)

16. **Harvest auto-pause never triggers** — Condition checked `harvestable && overripeDaysRemaining === 30` but overripeDaysRemaining is -1 when crop first reaches harvestable. Fixed to trigger on `growthStage === 'harvestable'`.

17. **Auto-pause priority order** — Events were displayed in insertion order, not urgency order. Added `AUTO_PAUSE_PRIORITY` map and stable sort in `simulateTick`.

18. **Plant/Water Field skips confirmation** — Affordable field-scope bulk ops executed immediately without confirmation. SPEC requires confirmation always. Fixed.

19. **Column bulk actions missing** — SidePanel only had row-scope buttons. Added Plant/Harvest/Water Column buttons per SPEC §2.3/§2.5/§2.6.

20. **Manual save to named slot** — Only auto-save existed. Added named slots keyed by "Year N Season", title screen load/delete menu.

21. **hasSaveData() false positive** — Returned true for manual-only saves, showing misleading "Continue" button. Fixed to only check auto-save.

22. **DD-1 complete rows counted partial rows** — Partial plant offers included partially-filled rows. Fixed to require all cells in a row to be empty.

23. **Missing data-testids** — Added conditional testids for gameover-panel, year30-panel, autopause-dismiss, save-new-game per SPEC §11.

24. **RNG continuity in warmup** — `createInitialState` warmup only called `generateDailyWeather`, not `updateExtremeEvents`, causing RNG state drift. Fixed to call both.

25. **Event probability under-targeting** — Linear `p/90` approximation under-targets by ~28% at p=0.4. Replaced with exact formula `1-(1-p)^(1/90)`.

26. **Streak test gap** — Only checked `maxStreak >= 3`, not all streaks. Fixed to validate `minStreak >= 3`.

27. **Bulk ops bypass processCommand** — Affordable-path confirm callbacks called engine functions directly, skipping validation. Fixed to route through `processCommand`.

28. **Duplicate testids on crop buttons** — Per-crop buttons shared testids. Fixed by including cropId: `action-plant-all-{cropId}`.

29. **Unsafe cast in warmup** — `warmup as GameState` was brittle. Extracted `ExtremeEventState` interface.

### Resolved from Slice 2a Senior Engineer Review (2026-02-24)

31. **HIGH: Event/advisor dismiss deadlocks activeEvent** — Dismissing event/advisor auto-pause overlay called `handleDismissAutoPause()` without clearing `activeEvent`, permanently blocking all future events (evaluateEvents returns null when activeEvent is set). Fixed: `dismissAutoPause` now detects event/advisor reason and clears activeEvent, logging as `__dismissed__`.

32. **HIGH: Foreshadowing fires same tick as event** — `evaluateEvents` created foreshadowing and fired the event in the same evaluation pass, defeating the purpose of advance warnings. Fixed: complete foreshadowing lifecycle — when conditions pass, foreshadow is created but event is NOT eligible to fire. Event becomes eligible only when `totalDay >= eventFiresOnDay`. False alarms expire silently at `eventFiresOnDay`.

33. **MEDIUM: Irrigation cost multiplier not in affordability checks** — `processWater` used base `IRRIGATION_COST_PER_CELL` for affordability but `executeWater` applied the event-driven cost multiplier, allowing watering when the player couldn't actually afford it. Fixed: `processWater` now applies `getIrrigationCostMultiplier()` in all affordability calculations. Adapter's water confirmation dialog also updated.

34. **LOW: Event RNG warmup no-op loop** — Empty for-loop with misleading comment about future consistency. Removed loop, added clear comment explaining why no event RNG warmup is needed.

35. **TAKE_LOAN guard** — `TAKE_LOAN` command was valid at any time (only checked `totalLoansReceived`). Fixed: now requires active `loan_offer` in `autoPauseQueue`, preventing command from being dispatched outside the loan offer flow.

### Resolved from Slice 2a Senior Engineer Review Round 2 (2026-02-24)

36. **MEDIUM: Foreshadowed events dropped on maturity day** — When multiple events matured on the same tick, all mature foreshadows were dismissed before weighted selection. If a foreshadowed event lost the random roll, its foreshadow was gone permanently. Fixed: foreshadowed events now fire with guaranteed priority (the player was warned, so the event must follow through). Only one fires per tick; others stay pending for subsequent ticks.

37. **LOW: Migration fallback used hardcoded event RNG seed** — `migrateV1ToV2` set `eventRngState = 42` for v1 saves. Fixed: now derives seed from `SLICE_1_SCENARIO.seed + EVENT_RNG_SEED_OFFSET` to match what `createInitialState` would produce.

### Resolved from Slice 2a Review Round 3 (2026-02-24)

38. **MEDIUM: False-alarm foreshadow churn** — Dismissed false-alarm foreshadows were immediately re-created on the same tick because Phase 2 saw no pending foreshadow for the storylet. Fixed: Phase 2 now skips storylets with foreshadows dismissed on the current day (`eventFiresOnDay === totalDay`).

39. **Loan panel browser test unskipped** — Added `window.__gameDebug` hook (setCash, setDay, setDebt, triggerEvent, etc.) for Playwright state injection. Loan tests now force `cash=0` directly, enabling 3 new browser tests: panel appears, accept adds debt, decline ends game. Removed `test.skip`.

40. **HIGH: Flaky event panel browser tests** — Event panel tests relied on `dismissAutoPausesUntil` waiting for natural RNG-driven events (probabilistic timing). Failed 1/5 under stress. Fixed: `triggerEvent` debug hook injects events directly, making event panel structure/interaction tests deterministic. Foreshadow test kept as natural-flow (tests the whole pipeline). Originally stress-tested 30/30 passes. **Regression after 4c/4d rebalancing:** foreshadowing test (game.spec.ts:884) now fails ~10% under `--repeat-each=20` (2/20). Root cause: changed economic parameters (STARTING_NITROGEN 95→99, IRRIGATION_COST 24→8, ANNUAL_OVERHEAD added) shift the simulation trajectory so condition-only advisors sometimes fire before any seasonal draw event. The test assumes `fastForward` always stops on a foreshadowed event, but condition-only advisors have no foreshadowing. Fix: filter to only count seasonal events, or use `triggerEvent` to inject a foreshadowed event deterministically.

### Resolved from Slice 2c Senior Engineer Review (2026-02-25)

41. **MEDIUM: "Apply Nitrogen Fertilizer" advisor choice was a no-op** — The `advisor-soil-nitrogen` storylet's "buy fertilizer" choice had `modify_cash: -400` but no effect on soil nitrogen. Students paid $400 for nothing. Fixed: added `modify_nitrogen_all` effect type to the effect system. Buy-fertilizer choice now applies +60 nitrogen to all cells, clamped to [0, 200].

42. **MEDIUM: Manual-save migration not surfaced in Load Game list** — `readSave()` had V1→V2→V3 migration, but `listManualSaves()` used `validateSave()` (exact version match only). Old-version manual saves were invisible in the Load Game menu despite being loadable. Fixed: `listManualSaves()` now uses the same migration chain as `readSave()`.

43. **LOW: Chill accumulation ~1.1% under target** — Dormancy entry day did an early `return` before the accumulation block, so 89/90 dormancy days accumulated chill. Over a winter with 800 target chill hours, the actual total was ~791. Fixed: removed early return; dormancy entry day now falls through to the accumulation block.

44. **LOW (hygiene): playwright-report tracked in git** — Generated `playwright-report/` and `test-results/` directories were not in `.gitignore`. Fixed: added both to `.gitignore`.

### Playtest Findings — Slice 3b (2026-02-26)

Two students were instructed to "play badly" (try to lose). Neither triggered bankruptcy. One submitted a playtest log covering a full 30-year run.

**45. Economy is too lenient — impossible to lose with almond monoculture.** RESOLVED (4c + 4d).
Severity: HIGH (balance). Originally: student planted 64 almonds, finished year 30 with $404,223. No failure pressure.
Resolution: Sub-Slice 4c added four economic levers (OM yield penalty, water allocation enforcement, nitrogen tightening, irrigation cost increase). Sub-Slice 4d added $2,000/year annual overhead. Result: almond monoculture 0% survival, corn monoculture ~69% (risky), idle farm 0% (bankrupt year 27), diversified 100%. Balance verified across 500 headless runs (5 bots × 5 scenarios × 20 seeds). Good play (diversified strategy) still earns ~$670K — this is correct pedagogy (reward for smart decisions, not a cap on success).

**46. Tomato Market Surge fires when player has no tomatoes.** RESOLVED.
Severity: MEDIUM (event noise). `tomato-market-surge` had no precondition requiring tomato production. Fixed: added `has_crop: processing-tomatoes` precondition. Event now only fires when player actually has tomatoes planted.

**47. Event clustering feels spammy.**
Severity: MEDIUM (UX). Multiple events sometimes fire in the same season (heatwave + water cut + pumping ban + tomato surge). Each auto-pauses the game, requiring separate dismissal. Students reported it feeling more like whack-a-mole than strategic decision-making.
Status: Deferred to Slice 5. Touches engine scheduling + balance — will be designed alongside Slice 5 event surface expansion. Likely fix: per-season event cap (max 1-2 events per season) or mutual exclusion groups for related events.

**48. "Already harvested this season" confusion with perennials.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: LOW (UX polish). Players repeatedly clicked harvest on already-harvested perennials, getting failure messages.
Resolution: Harvest button disabled when `crop.harvestedThisSeason === true`. "Harvested this season" label shown in SidePanel. Tooltip explains status.

**49. Cover crop / soil health pedagogy not landing.**
Severity: LOW (content design). Organic matter trended steadily down (1.97% → 1.19% over 30 years) but the student never engaged with cover crops. The payoff isn't visible enough in the UI. OM decline has no dramatic consequence the student can feel — it's a slow, invisible drain.
Status: Deferred. Needs design discussion — possible interventions: OM-triggered advisor warning, visible soil quality tier (Healthy → Degraded → Depleted), yield penalty at low OM thresholds.

**50. Pause-to-play transition is not intuitive.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: MEDIUM (UX).
Resolution: Pulsing "Press Play to continue" prompt shown near speed controls when speed === 0 and player has taken an action or dismissed an auto-pause. Prompt disappears when speed changes to > 0.

### Playtest Findings — Slice 4b Bad-Play QA (2026-03-02)

AI agent ran an intentional bad-play scenario (almond monoculture, no adaptation) against the 4b build.

**56. Tomato-market-surge reportedly fired on almond-only farm.** INCONCLUSIVE.
Severity: MEDIUM. QA log shows `event_fired: tomato-market-surge` at Year 2 spring with only almonds planted. Code review confirms `has_crop: processing-tomatoes` precondition is present and `evaluateCondition` logic is correct. Two regression tests added: (1) isolation test — 50 seeds × 100 ticks (5,000 `evaluateEvents` calls); (2) integration test — 20 seeds through full `simulateTick` engine path covering Year 1 + Year 2 spring (~500 ticks each). Event never fires in either. Unable to reproduce under current build; monitoring with regression tests and future web QA runs.
Status: Inconclusive. Regression tests in place (`slice3a1.test.ts`). Will monitor in future QA runs.

**57. Game Over "Total expenses" shows only final-year expenses.** RESOLVED.
Severity: LOW (misleading label). Bankruptcy panel said "Total revenue/expenses" but data came from `yearlyRevenue`/`yearlyExpenses` which reset each year. Label changed to "Final year revenue/expenses". TODO: show lifetime totals in 4e using `tracking.yearSnapshots`.

**58. Pre-loan vs post-loan cash confusion at year-end boundary.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: LOW (UX polish).
Resolution: Year-end panel cash label changed from "Cash Balance" to "Cash Balance (before loan)" to clarify the snapshot timing.

**60. SidePanel shows "Empty" for cells with cover crops.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: LOW (UX confusion).
Resolution: Changed label to "Fallow (Cover Crop)" when cell has a cover crop but no primary crop.

**61. Notification backlog overwhelms normal gameplay.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: **HIGH** (classroom readability — confirmed in live classroom run).
Resolution: Three-pronged fix: (1) Bulk harvest notifications batched by crop type (one notification per crop per bulk harvest). (2) Hard cap of 30 notifications — oldest dropped when exceeded. (3) Age-based trim at season boundaries — notifications older than 180 days removed.

**62. Harvest affordance misleads when selected plot is not ready.**
Severity: LOW (UX). "Harvest Field" button shows green/active when ANY plot is harvestable, even if the currently selected plot is at 85%. Students click expecting to harvest the selected cell. Should show "Harvest Field (N plots ready)" or clarify selected-plot state.
Status: Deferred to 4d.

**63. Event probabilities are effectively guaranteed annual occurrences.**
Severity: MEDIUM (design/balance). Events with 10% daily probability evaluated ~90 days/season have `1 - 0.9^90 ≈ 99.98%` chance per season.
Status: **RESOLVED** in Sub-Slice 4b.5. Moved 8 random-gated events to seasonal draw semantics (one roll per season, modulated by stress level, family caps). 6 condition-only advisors remain per-tick. Balance thresholds need re-establishment in 4c.

**59. Water warning click-fatigue.**
Severity: **HIGH** (classroom UX — confirmed in live classroom run). Repeated water_stress auto-pauses across multiple seasons cause dismissal fatigue. Classroom evidence: 13 water actions in 4 years, each requiring warning → confirm → resume loop. Related to #47 (event clustering) and #52 (double-gate).
Status: Open. **Recommended fix: automated irrigation as an early tech tree unlock** — the first purchasable tech, offered ~Year 2 at an affordable price. Teaches the tech tree mechanic while solving the #1 UX pain point. If refused, offer again later (~Year 4) so students who couldn't afford it initially get a second chance. This makes the tech tree immediately valuable and the irrigation loop opt-out rather than mandatory suffering. Requires tech tree infrastructure (deferred to future slice).

### AI QA Playthrough Findings (2026-03-04)

30-year playthrough by well-intentioned AI agent. Cross-referenced against code and existing issues.

**64. Tomato Market Surge timing drifts post-harvest in late years.**
Severity: LOW (design). Event fires after summer harvest in 16/28 years, meaning the price bonus has no strategic value — player can't act on it. In late years, the event often fires when no tomatoes exist or harvest is already complete.
Status: Deferred to future content slice. Fix: tighten the firing window to pre-harvest (spring/early summer), or add a "forward contract" mechanic so the price bonus applies to next season's harvest.

**65. Year-30 completion panel lacks educational summary.**
Severity: MEDIUM (educational value). Current UI: "Congratulations!" title + "Start New Game" button. No financial arc, soil health delta, key decision highlights, or reflection prompts. The tracking data exists in `yearSnapshots` — the UI just doesn't surface it. For a classroom tool, this is the most important screen students will see.
Status: Deferred to future slice. Requires design discussion on what metrics to highlight and what reflection questions to prompt.

**66. Soil management has limited agency after early advisor caps.**
Severity: LOW (design). `advisor-soil-nitrogen` fires max 3 times (intentional cap in events.ts). Cover crops provide recurring nitrogen restoration (+50N per incorporation), but there's no explicit "fertilize" or "soil amendment" action. After early advisor hints stop, players lack ongoing feedback about soil health trajectory.
Status: Deferred. Design question: add recurring soil tools (fertilizer purchase, soil testing), raise/remove advisor caps, or accept current cover-crop-only path. Cover crops ARE the intended answer pedagogically — but players may not realize it without continued prompting.

**67. "Continue Saved Game" can appear but do nothing when auto-save is invalid/corrupt.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: MEDIUM (resume UX + trust).
Resolution: `hasSaveData()` now calls `loadAutoSave() !== null` instead of checking key existence. Corrupt autosave = Continue button hidden.

### Exploit-Hunter QA Findings (2026-03-05)

AI agent ran targeted exploit-hunting session. Cross-referenced against code.

**68. Autosave desyncs after loading a manual save.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: MEDIUM (data integrity / resume UX).
Resolution: Added `autoSave(_liveState)` call at end of `loadSavedGame()`. One-line fix.

**69. "New Game" button has no confirmation guard.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: LOW (UX — auto-save provides safety net).
Resolution: Added confirm dialog before `returnToTitle()`. Uses `'return-to-title'` ConfirmActionId with message "Return to title screen? Your game is auto-saved at each season boundary."

**70. Confirm dialog can be overwritten by scripted interaction (automation only).**
Severity: LOW (automation hardening — human clicks blocked by overlay).
Status: Open / Deferred.

What happens: No guard checks `confirmDialog.value` before assignment. If a scripted `.click()` fires on a SidePanel bulk button while a confirm dialog is open, the pending confirm is silently replaced. Human clicks are blocked by the full-viewport overlay (`position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 100`).

Expected: Either guard against overwrite or explicitly cancel the pending confirm's callbacks before replacement.

Actual: Pending confirm's `onConfirm`/`onCancel` callbacks are silently dropped.

Evidence:
- All 7 `confirmDialog.value = {...}` assignments have no guard: `src/adapter/signals.ts:336,356,414,434,489,510` + `src/ui/components/SidePanel.tsx:83`.
- Overlay CSS blocks human clicks: `src/ui/styles/Overlay.module.css:3-11`.
Refs: src/adapter/signals.ts:336, src/ui/styles/Overlay.module.css:3

Suggested fix: Add `if (confirmDialog.value) return;` guard at top of each bulk action, or disable action handlers when confirm is open.

**Non-issues confirmed:**
- EX-01: No cash duplication via save/load. Engine state is snapshot-based; loading overwrites, doesn't merge.
- EX-02: No double-harvest payout. `harvestedThisSeason` flag prevents re-harvest.
- EX-10: No out-of-season replant exploit. `processPlant` validates planting window.
- EX-04/05: Speed buttons clickable during dialogs — cosmetic only. Overlay blocks human clicks; tick loop is independently gated by `autoPauseQueue.length === 0`. No state corruption.
- EX-07: Cross-session save visibility — by design (BUG-09, KNOWN_ISSUES line 228). Save keys are global, not player-namespaced.

### Classroom Reality-Check Findings (2026-03-05)

Observed during live classroom session with students + TA feedback. High-confidence findings.

**71. No perennial onboarding warning — multi-year zero-revenue trap.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: **HIGH** (classroom UX + pedagogy).
Resolution: First perennial plant per game shows years-to-first-harvest warning in confirm dialog. Flag persisted via `state.flags['perennialWarningShown']` — survives save/load, resets on new game.

**72. Advisor recommendation timing mismatch ("plant winter wheat").** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: MEDIUM (classroom confusion).
Resolution: Updated notification text to be season-agnostic: "Dr. Santos recommends planting winter wheat in the fall to restore nitrogen naturally. Cover crops also help rebuild soil fertility."

**73. No running net P/L visible during the year.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: MEDIUM (classroom comprehension).
Resolution: Added "Year net: +$X,XXX" / "Year net: -$X,XXX" display to TopBar. Green when positive, red when negative. Uses existing `yearlyRevenue - yearlyExpenses` data.

**74. Crop icon color/state misread as harvest-ready on Chromebook screens.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: MEDIUM (classroom UX — TA-observed).
Resolution: Three reinforcing signals: (1) "Ready!" text badge on harvestable cells (color-independent). (2) SidePanel growth text enhanced with explicit "Not ready yet" prefix for growing crops. (3) Disabled harvest button tooltip shows crop name + growth %. Additionally, all growth stages replaced with custom art images (no emoji), improving visual distinction between stages.

**Non-issues (repro needed before promoting):**
- "Load Game non-functional" — cannot reproduce; load system works in all tests. Treat as tester interaction issue until repro steps provided.
- "Continue requires Player ID confusion" — by design (BUG-09). Continue uses auto-save, not player ID.

### Deferred — Accepted for Slice 1

30. **Deep save validation** — Nested field tampering (e.g., modifying crop.gddAccumulated inside a valid grid structure) is not caught by `validateSave()`. Acceptable risk for classroom use — students are not adversarial. Could add deep schema validation in a future slice if needed.

### Deferred from Slice 2 → Slice 3 (partially resolved)

**Resolved in Slice 3:**
- ~~Stretch events~~ — `tomato-market-surge` and `groundwater-pumping-ban` implemented in 3a1
- ~~Perennial decline phase / age-based yield curves~~ — 3-phase piecewise-linear yield curves (ramp → peak → decline → floor) implemented in 3a2
- ~~Cover crops~~ — Legume cover crop system (fall planting, spring incorporation, N/OM bonus) implemented in 3b
- ~~Additional crops~~ — Sorghum (drought-tolerant annual) and Citrus Navels (evergreen perennial) added in 3a1

**Still deferred → Slice 4+:**
- **Tech tree** — Fog-of-war event-driven tech unlocks (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.4). Not started.
- **Remaining advisors** — Financial Advisor/Banker, Farming Community. (Weather Service completed in 3c.)
- **Insurance / credit systems** — Credit rating, variable loan rates, insurance premiums.
- **K + Zn nutrients** — Only nitrogen is modeled.
- **Additional crops** — Grapes, Stone Fruit, Agave, Heat-tolerant Avocados, Opuntia, Guayule remain.
- **Additional climate scenarios** — Only 1 scenario exists. Need 5-8 for classroom use.

### AI Playtest Findings — Slice 3b Build (2026-02-26)

Automated playtest by Claude agent. Triaged per senior engineer review. Verified against code.

**51. "Plant Field" bulk buttons silently fail when some plots are occupied.** RESOLVED.
Severity: HIGH (functional). Root cause: `plantBulk()` in `signals.ts` returned early with no feedback when no fully-empty rows existed. The engine had the right error message; the adapter never asked for it. BUG-03 is the same root cause. Fixed: adapter now routes through `processCommand` and shows an info notification with the engine's error message ("No fully empty rows available. Use Plant Row to fill specific rows.").

**52. Water Warning action chains into second confirm dialog (double-gate).** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: **HIGH** (automation + UX flow friction in long sessions).
Resolution: Added `skipConfirm` option to `waterBulk()` with 3-way affordability return type (`applied_full` | `applied_partial` | `failed`). Auto-pause primary action uses `skipConfirm: true` — single click applies water directly. Manual side-panel watering still shows confirm dialog. Auto-pause only dismisses on success (full or partial); stays open if player can't afford any irrigation.

**53. Year-end expenses don't break down categories.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: MEDIUM (transparency).
Resolution: Year-end panel now shows 9-category expense breakdown (planting, watering, harvest labor, maintenance, cover crops, annual overhead, loan repayment, event costs, crop removal) with zero-value suppression. Data was already in `event.data.expenseBreakdown` — just needed UI rendering.

**54. Calendar display doesn't advance immediately after "Continue to Year 2".** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: LOW (cosmetic).
Resolution: `handleDismissAutoPause()` now advances display calendar fields (year/month/day/season) to next day values before publishing state, preventing one-frame lag.

**55. Row/Column plant buttons don't show per-plot cost.** RESOLVED (4e).
Severity: LOW (UX polish).
Resolution: Added `($/plot)` to row and column plant buttons, matching field-level pattern.

**Non-bugs (verified):**
- BUG-07 (selected cell after load): Code clears `selectedCell.value = null` in both `resumeGame` and `loadSavedGame`. Could not reproduce — likely transient rendering.
- BUG-09 (Continue doesn't require Player ID): By design — save is keyed to browser localStorage, not player ID. Classroom isolation is via separate Chromebook logins.
- BUG-08 (notification count growing): By design — notifications persist within a year. Could cap or auto-dismiss, but this is a design decision, not a bug.
- OBS-03 (annual crops auto-clear): This is the overripe grace period (30 days, then crop rots). Auto-pause fires at harvest-ready. Notification exists for crop rotting. Working as designed per SPEC DD-4.
- OBS-04 (moisture hits 0.0): Correct simulation behavior. Perennials survive dormancy at 0 moisture (reduced kc).
- OBS-05 (no undo for planting): By design per DECISIONS.md — no undo system. Row/column plant buttons skip confirmation intentionally (only field-scope requires confirmation per SPEC §2.3).
- OBS-01 (click outside to deselect): Design suggestion, not a bug. Filed mentally.
- OBS-02 (no planting window tooltips): Good suggestion for Slice 4 glossary/info system.

### Deferred to Slice 4 / Later Discussion

- **Balance testing suite** — Headless automated strategy tests running full 30-year games against multiple scenarios (ARCHITECTURE.md §12 Layer 2). Required before classroom deployment. Strategies to test: monoculture almond, monoculture corn, diversified adaptive, zero-irrigation, maximum debt. Target: monoculture should fail in ≥60% of drought-heavy scenarios; well-diversified strategies should survive ≥80%. See playtest findings #45.
- **Economic rebalancing** — Starting cash, maintenance costs, drought severity, event impacts all need systematic tuning based on balance test results. NOT hand-tuned — data-driven from headless test suite.
- **Event system tuning** — Per-season event cap, mutual exclusion groups, relevance gating (see #46, #47).
- **Web-aware AI exploratory QA** — Supplement headless balance bots with AI agents playing the actual web UI via Playwright/browser automation. Catches UX, decision-quality, and exploitability issues that headless engine-only bots cannot see. Six player personas defined: (1) Optimal-seeking strategist, (2) Intentional self-sabotage, (3) Advisor maximizer, (4) Advisor skeptic, (5) Low-effort student, (6) Late adapter. Each run produces: decision log by year/season, top-5 observations, outcome summary, bugs/UX issues. Planned timing: initial runs after 4b baseline (optimal + sabotage), regression during 4c tuning (optimal + low-effort), full sweep after 4d+4e for classroom sign-off. See Slice 4 plan sub-slice 4d.5.
- **Automation policies** — Replant-same, harvest-when-ready, water-when-dry. Unlocked via tech tree.
- **Glossary / Information Index** — In-game educational reference with progressive disclosure.
- **Solar lease event chain** — Multi-phase storylet (option → construction → operations → agrivoltaics).
- **Completion code + Google Form** — End-of-game reporting for teacher assessment.
- **Advanced accessibility** (colorblind modes, full screen reader support) — Baseline keyboard nav + ARIA in Slice 1.
- **Sound / music** — Not essential for classroom use.
- **Farm expansion (neighbor buyout)** — Likely v2, not Classroom-Ready Build.

### Deferred — Post-Slice 4 / Academic Integrity

- **Agent policy notice (soft deterrent)** — Production-only `<meta name="ai-agent-policy">` tag asking well-behaved AI agents not to play the game for students. Low effort (~30 min), only a soft deterrent for agents that respect such instructions. Implementation: inject in `src/main.tsx` gated on `import.meta.env.PROD`. Verify with test: present in prod build, absent in dev.
- **Behavioral suspicion scoring** — Client-side heuristic to flag sessions that look AI-automated: `event.isTrusted === false`, inhuman action timing (fast + perfectly regular), scripted sweep patterns, zero hover/scroll behavior with high throughput. Produces a `suspicionScore` with confidence band (low/medium/high). If above threshold, marks session as `tainted_for_review` in teacher report with "interview student for understanding" recommendation. Important limits: cannot detect passive DOM reading; good automation can mimic humans; assistive tech can false-positive. NOT auto-fail — teacher triage tool only. Requires completion code / teacher reporting infrastructure (4f) to be useful.
